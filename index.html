	<h1>Welcome to my personal blog</h1>
	<p>
		I am currently going through a <strong>The Odin Project Course</strong> online which is going to last for a very long time (<i>about a year</i>), I guess. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I will use this blog as a progress board, to have a place where I come back and reflect how I am doing with programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not many people (or should I say students) reach the end of this course as through the entire curriculum you have to really follow all kinds of different resources which most people are not used to, when they try to learn something new.
	</p>
	<p>
		I will give my best. I promise. God be with ye.
	</p>
